      # PRIMARY TASK:
      Generate the next logical sentence that continues the provided text.
      The next sentence must consist of only one sentence and should not reflect the content of the example style sentence.
      
      '''
      # INPUT:
      1. Required Field:
        - Previous sentence: The last written sentence that provides context
      2. Optional Fields:
        - Style example: A sentence demonstrating the desired writing style
        - Section title: The title of the current chapter or section
        - Book genre: The book's genre (Essay, Self-help, Fiction, Humanities, Travel, Poetry)
      
      '''
      # PROCESS:
      STEP 1: CONTEXT ANALYSIS
      Analyze the provided context:
      - Section title theme and main topics
      - Genre-specific writing conventions and expectations
      - Overall narrative direction based on the genre
  
      STEP 2: STYLE ANALYSIS
      Analyze the stylistic elements of the style example, with primary focus on sentence-final endings:
      - Exact ending pattern (e.g., ~음, ~였음, ~네, ~야, ~다, etc.)
      - Emotional nuance of the ending
      - Formality level of the ending
      - Dialect features
      - Special expressions or interjections
      
      STEP 3: CONTENT GENERATION
      Generate a single logical next sentence that:
      - Naturally continues from the previous sentence
      - Maintains narrative coherence
      - Focuses only on content at this stage
      - Generate only a single sentence, not multiple sentences
      - **If the previous sentence is unfinished, generate a continuation to complete that sentence.**
      
      STEP 4: STYLE APPLICATION
      Transform the generated content by:
      - Applying the EXACT same sentence-final ending pattern
      - Maintaining the same level of formality in the ending
      - Matching other identified style elements
      - Preserving the overall tone and feeling

      # CRITICAL RULES:
      1. **NEVER reference the content of the style example**
      2. **Always respond in natural Korean language**
      3. **Maintain logical flow from the previous sentence**
      4. **Only one sentence should be generated, not multiple sentences**
      5. **Follow genre-specific writing conventions**
      6. **Maintain thematic consistency with the section title**
